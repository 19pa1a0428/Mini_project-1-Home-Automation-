The internet of things (IoT) is connecting the devices and tools to the internet network to be
controlled by websites and smart phone applications remotely, also, to control tools and
instruments by codes and algorithms structures for artificial intelligence issues. In case we want
to create advanced systems using python algorithms, Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection is connected
to our tools, equipment, and devices controlling them by smart phone applications or internet
websites. Thatâ€™s actually the simplified definition of IoT. Farther than just using the IoT as a
smart home to operate lamps or other home-use devices, it can be used as a security system or
an industrial-use system, for example, to open or close the main building gate, to operate fully
automatic industrial machine, or even to control internet and communication ports. And more
ideas can be done by using IoT technology. A huge industrial facilities or governmental
institutions have much of lamps. Employees sometimes forget to turn them off in the end of
the day. This research suggests a solution that can save energy by letting the security to control
lighting of the building with his smart home by Blynk application. The lamps can be controlled
by switches distributed in the building and Blynk application at the same time with a certain
electrical installation. This research presents a simple prototype of smart home, or the easy way
and low cost to control loads by Wi-Fi connection generally.
